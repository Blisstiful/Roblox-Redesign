					Woah woah! Slow down.
					Thank you for taking interest in my project :)
					I'm sure you were expecting it to go somewhere,
					but this project is set to one page of content.
					If you liked what you saw then maybe take the time to 
					look at my other projects at github.com/vdelaide!
					If you have any questions, you can contact me @ 
					"vdelaide" on discord.
