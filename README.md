# Roblox-Redesign

Created by **vdelaide** on Github

## What is this project?

This is meant to give me more opportunities to use and structure React projects.
It's also mainly inspired by my annoyance at Roblox's homepage layout, and hopefully
is a breath of fresh air.

## Features: 

- Modularity
- Use of data to demonstrate React's reactivity
- One page of content
- x different ui components
